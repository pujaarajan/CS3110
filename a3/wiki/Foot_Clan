<p>In the universe of <a href="Kevin_Eastman" title="Kevin Eastman">Eastman</a> and <a href="Peter_Laird" title="Peter Laird">Laird</a>'s <a href="Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(Mirage_Studios)" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)"><i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i></a>, the Foot Clan was founded in Feudal Japan by two men named Sato and Oshi. In Volume 1 Issue 47, the Turtles and <a href="List_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_characters#Renet" title="List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters">Time Mistress Renet</a> traveled to a time prior to the Foot's creation. There, <a href="Raphael_(TMNT)" title="Raphael (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Raphael</a> met Sato and Oshi, and, not realising who they are, he taught them about Ninjutsu. After the Turtles returned to the present, Sato and Oshi decided to follow the ways of the ninja. Oshi declared: "We must never again mention the strange shelled creatures. In time, others will join us and we will become a force to be reckoned with. So just as every journey begins with a single step... we shall call ourselves The Foot."</p>
<p>The Foot Clan are the most feared clan of warriors and assassins in <a href="Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Both Hamato Yoshi and Oroku Nagi were members, until one day, they fought over the love of Tang Shen and Yoshi killed Nagi. Dishonored, Yoshi was exiled to <a href="New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, while Nagi's younger brother Oroku Saki was adopted by the clan and was trained to become a fierce <a href="Ninja" title="Ninja">ninja</a>. When he was ready, Saki was sent to New York to start the American branch of the Clan. Under his leadership, it took only a year for it to become a powerful and fearsome group.</p>
<p>Saki also sought vengeance for his brother and, using the persona of "The Shredder", he assassinated Yoshi. Over a decade later, the Ninja Turtles challenged Shredder to a rooftop duel to avenge Yoshi. Shredder sent his Foot Ninja to fight the Turtles, but they were no match for the Turtles and were eventually defeated. Shredder then fought the Turtles himself, and although he was a more skilled ninja than them, he was killed when he fell off a building carrying a bomb.</p>
<p>After Shredder's death, the American Foot fell apart, and the Foot Soldiers began fighting against Shredder's elite guard. <a href="Karai" title="Karai">Karai</a>, a clan leader from Japan, came here to stop the clan war. She enlisted the Turtles' help in this, in exchange for promising that no Foot shall ever try to avenge the Shredder again. This truce is still in effect in Volume 4 of the comic.</p>
<p>In Volume 4 the Foot were given a security contract by the Utroms for their base because the Utroms have a no weapons policy and the Foot are skilled at hand to hand combat. At some point mysterious Aztec warriors started to attack the Foot all over the world. Karai informed <a href="Leonardo_(TMNT)" title="Leonardo (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Leonardo</a> that the New York Branch of the Foot was all that was left.</p>
<p>The Foot Clan's logo is a drawing of a left <a href="Foot" title="Foot">foot</a>. Issues 3 and 4 of the new <i><a href="Tales_of_the_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles" title="Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles">Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></i> feature a Foot mystic with magical abilities, including the power to resurrect the dead.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Foot_Clan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: The 1987 series and the TMNT Adventures">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_1987_series_and_the_TMNT_Adventures">The 1987 series and the TMNT Adventures</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(1987_cartoon)" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 cartoon)" class="mw-redirect">1987 series</a> and the spin-off <a href="Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Adventures" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures"><i>TMNT Adventures</i></a> comics share a similar continuity, and thus the same version of the Foot Clan. The Foot is an ancient Ninjutsu clan, founded in Japan in 1583. The Shredder, followed by the Turtles and <a href="Splinter_(TMNT)" title="Splinter (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Splinter</a>, went back in time to try to influence the creation of the Foot Clan. In 1583, Shredder's ancestor Oroku Sancho led a small group of ninja, and Shredder offered to help him find a magical artifact that would give him the power to form a real Clan. Meanwhile, Splinter's ancestor Hamato Koji had been sent to find the same artifact, and did find it with the help of his descendant and the Turtles. The artifact released a <a href="Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a>, which headed for a nearby city; Splinter and Koji went to stop it while the Turtles went to fight Shredder. Sancho's men captured the Turtles, and were about to execute them when Koji arrived, riding the dragon, which he had tamed. Seeing this, Sancho fled in fear, and Koji offered to lead Sancho's men and founded the Foot Clan, so named for the footprint of the dragon in which he stood as he made his speech. (However, according to "Blast from the Past", the Foot was founded by a noble warrior named Shibana-Sama.)</p>
<p>In 1960s Japan, both Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were part of the Clan. Saki framed Yoshi for trying to kill a <a href="Sensei" title="Sensei">sensei</a> of the clan and had him exiled to New York City, thus clearing the way to take over the Foot Clan. He then proceeded to turn the Foot Clan into an army of criminals. Over the years, Saki, who became known as The Shredder, moved to the USA, allied himself with the alien warlord <a href="Krang" title="Krang">Krang</a>, and replaced the human Foot Ninja with robotic Foot Soldiers. However, these robots are no match for the Ninja Turtles, who destroy them at every encounter.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the cartoon, The Shredder once considered making more intelligent Foot Soldiers, capable of learning and taking decisions by themselves. However, the idea was quickly abandoned when the first intelligent prototype, named Alpha 1, rebelled against The Shredder.</p>
<p>The Foot Clan's logo is a drawing of a right foot, and the Foot Soldiers wear purple and black uniforms featuring the logo on their foreheads. The Foot logo can also be seen on the <a href="Technodrome" title="Technodrome">Technodrome</a>.</p>
<p>The Archie <i>TMNT Adventures</i> comics features more advanced Foot Soldiers in addition to the basic model. In the comics, The Shredder also built a giant Foot Soldier, who fought against the Warrior Dragon in New York City. The robot was destroyed when it crashed into the <a href="Statue_of_Liberty" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>.</p>
<p>The Foot robot concept allowed the Turtles to destroy the Foot soldiers without any moral thoughts, allowing <a href="Leonardo_(TMNT)" title="Leonardo (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Leonardo</a> and <a href="Raphael_(TMNT)" title="Raphael (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Raphael</a> to use their weapons more offensively. Meanwhile the series could keep its younger audience and remain a "family show". This principle also benefited the video games.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Foot_Clan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Movies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Movies">Movies</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(film)" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film)">first</a> and <a href="Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_II:_The_Secret_of_the_Ooze" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze">second</a> movies, the Foot Clan is a group of ninja thieves and assassins founded by the Shredder in Japan, but later stationed in New York. The Shredder had taken what Foot Soldiers he had from Japan, and began taking kids from the streets upon moving to New York and training them in Ninjutsu himself. His second-in-command is another Ninjutsu master called Tatsu.</p>
<p>The Foot Ninja were no match for the Turtles individually, however their first major confrontation with the Turtles resulted in Raphael beaten nearly to death and the remaining Turtles forced to retreat; all confrontations after showed the Turtles being able to defeat the Foot easily. After the Shredder's apparent death and massive arrests by the NYPD, the clan was reduced to a fraction of its former size. Tatsu tried to take command, but relinquished his claim when the Shredder returned. The clan then kidnapped professor Jordon Perry and forced him to make a mutagen so the Foot Clan could create two mutant warriors, <a href="Tokka_and_Rahzar" title="Tokka and Rahzar">Tokka and Rahzar</a>, to fight the Turtles. Although these two mutants were a match for the Turtles in physical strength, the Turtles defeated them by de-mutating them back into harmless animals. The Shredder himself apparently died shortly after, while fighting the Turtles.</p>
<p>In the <a href="TMNT_(film)" title="TMNT (film)">fourth</a> film, the Foot is now under leadership of <a href="Karai" title="Karai">Karai</a>, who has taken control after the Shredder's demise. They have grown in numbers and skill, and offer their services as mercenaries in the film. They are hired by Max Winters to track down and bring in the 13 monsters arriving in New York City. Eventually, they later learn of his intention to send the monsters back to their world with a portal, and that his stone generals have betrayed him by substituting Leonardo for the thirteenth monster in order to use the portal to bring in a new army of monsters to take over the Earth. It was then the Stone Generals demand that Karai and the Foot Clan serve them, but they refused, as they want to honor their deal with Winters. Without hesistation, Karai orders the Foot Clan to help April and Casey find the last monster and lure it into the portal while the Turtles fights the Generals as well as Winters and Splinter warding off new more coming from the portal. After the final monster is sent in to the portal along with Stone Generals, Karai and the Foot Clan peacefully part ways with the Turtles, reminding them of the Shredder's possible return.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Foot_Clan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ninja_Turtles:_The_Next_Mutation">Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation</span></h2>
<p>In the 1997-1998 <i><a href="Ninja_Turtles:_The_Next_Mutation" title="Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation">Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation</a></i> series, the Foot Clan is a <a href="Street_gang" title="Street gang" class="mw-redirect">street gang</a>, similar to the movies. After the Turtles defeated The Shredder, the Turtles told the kids that the Foot is a lie, and the clan was disbanded.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Foot_Clan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: The 2003 series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_2003_series">The 2003 series</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(2003_cartoon)" title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 cartoon)" class="mw-redirect">2003 series</a>, the Foot Clan is more similar to its original comic version. The Foot Clan are a group of warriors and assassins that Shredder created 700 years ago in Japan. The Shredder, who in this series is a long-lived Utrom, has led the Clan since its creation and has turned it into a fearsome and secret group present across the world. The Foot emblem is a red, trident-like footprint (hence the name of the clan), an inverted version of the "Three-Toed Sign of the Dragon", the symbol of the five warriors who had defeated the original demon known as the Shredder in 300 AD. Thanks to Shredder's knowledge of Utrom technology, the Clan has weapons and equipment centuries ahead of human technology. They once created Foot Mechs in <i><a href="Rogue_in_the_House_(TMNT_2003_Episode)" title="Rogue in the House (TMNT 2003 Episode)" class="mw-redirect">Rogue in the House</a></i>, which were based on Master Splinter, the President, the Prime Minister, and some others.</p>
<p>The Foot Clan is divided into several branches. The most commonly-encountered, and seemingly most numerous, branch are the Foot Ninja, the basic warriors of the Foot. They're generally depicted as easily beaten except in very large groups. When Karai started working in New York, they received extra training from her and became much harder for the Turtles to defeat. Next, the Foot Clan's technicians have cybernetic enhancements but are rarely ever seen in fights. The Foot Tech Ninja are warriors with specialized stealth armor that allows them to become seemingly invisible. They also possess greatly enhanced physical speed and strength, but their invisibility is what always gives the Turtles and their allies trouble. The various video games introduced the Foot Gunners and the sumo-wrestling Mega Foots, although only the Foot Gunners then went on to appear in the TV series as Foot Mechs.</p>
<p>The powerful but seldom seen Foot Mystics are five magic-users, each one with powers corresponding to a different natural element: wind, earth, fire, water and metal. In the episode <i><a href="http://www.wikia.comc:TMNT:Bad_Day" class="extiw" title="wikia:TMNT:Bad Day">Bad Day</a></i>, it is revealed that the Foot Mystics have Black Magic powers, when they launch an attack against the Turtles on an <a href="Astral_plane" title="Astral plane">astral plane</a>. It is also revealed that they obey and serve whoever holds a medallion called the <a href="http://www.wikia.comc:TMNT:Heart_of_Tengu" class="extiw" title="wikia:TMNT:Heart of Tengu">Heart of Tengu</a>. It is also said Shredder had more respect for their power than Karai, but she repeatedly tells them that as long as she had the medallion, they will obey her with no questions asked. This later leads them to trick <a href="Baxter_Stockman" title="Baxter Stockman">Baxter Stockman</a> to destroy the Heart, in the episode <i><a href="http://www.wikia.comc:TMNT:Good_Genes,_Part_2" class="extiw" title="wikia:TMNT:Good Genes, Part 2">Good Genes, Part 2</a></i>, allowing them to become free. They then set out to restore the true Shredder. When freed the Mystics were able to revert back to their true forms and were shown to be far more powerful then previously shown. Despite their fanatical devotion to the demon Shredder, they were still abused by him for so much as saying anything he felt was out of line. They are eventually killed in <i><a href="http://www.wikia.comc:TMNT:Enter_the_Dragons,_Part_1" class="extiw" title="wikia:TMNT:Enter the Dragons, Part 1">Enter the Dragons, Part 1</a></i>, although in the Fast Forward episode <i><a href="http://www.wikia.comc:TMNT:The_Journal" class="extiw" title="wikia:TMNT:The Journal">The Journal</a></i> a Foot Mystic appeared before <a href="Raphael_(TMNT)" title="Raphael (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Raphael</a> and <a href="Casey_Jones_(TMNT)" title="Casey Jones (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Casey Jones</a> and teleported them to a deserted island in one of the pages of Casey and <a href="April_O%27Neil" title="April O'Neil">April's</a> journal that the Turtles were reading despite <a href="Splinter_(TMNT)" title="Splinter (TMNT)" class="mw-redirect">Splinter</a> and <a href="List_of_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_characters#Cody_Jones" title="List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters">Cody's</a> warnings not to read it. However, this particular event was a complete fabrication by Master Splinter and Cody in order to teach the Turtles a lesson.</p>
<p>The seemingly most-skilled of the clan warriors are the four Elite Foot Ninja. These Foot Clan members serve as the Shredder's elite guard, as well as field commanders on highly important missions. Each carries a different weapon: a trident, a spear, an axe, and a twin bladed sword (aside from their different weapons there's no way to tell them apart). They've all proven extremely deadly fighters, having easily defeated and nearly killed Leonardo when they first appeared.</p>
<p>The Clan itself is under the ultimate command of The Utrom Shredder, and his second in command is his adopted daughter <a href="Karai" title="Karai">Karai</a> and Hun. Prior to Karai's appearance, Hun served as Shredder's second and chief enforcer, but when Karai appeared she was quickly shown to be higher in Shredder's favor than Hun. After The Shredder was exiled to the ice asteroid belt of Mor Tal in the episode <i><a href="http://www.wikia.comc:TMNT:Exodus,_Part_2" class="extiw" title="wikia:TMNT:Exodus, Part 2">Exodus, Part 2</a></i>, Karai assumed command of the Clan, and the mantle of the Shredder, giving the Foot Ninja and Elite new designs.</p>
<p>Somehow after the events of the defeat of the Demon Shredder and the year the Turtles were stuck in the future in Fast Forward, Khan gained control of the Foot, now dressed in Cyber Foot armor. Under Khan's rule they were in a gang war against Hun and the Purple Dragons. Once Cyber Shredder appeared, he took control and it was Khan's mission to bring him back into reality. Many believe Khan was once an Elite Foot since his theme is the same theme used whenever the Elite Foot appeared.</p>
<p>Khan must have lost control of the Foot after Cyber Shredder's defeat because Karai was in control of the Foot once more in the movie <a href="Turtles_Forever" title="Turtles Forever">Turtles Forever</a>. At this point the Utrom Shredder returned by means of his counter part, the Shredder of the 1987 series. The <a href="Technodrome" title="Technodrome">Technodrome</a> became the headquarters for the Foot Clan of the 2003 series and the robotic foot soldiers were added to the Foot's fighting force after an upgrade with Utrom technology. Using Krang's mutagen they also added mutated soldiers to the Foot's soldiers. The Utrom Shredder kept the 1987 Shredder and Krang on to help lead the Foot, as well as Bebop and Rocksteady. However the Utrom Shredder turned on his counter part and Krang late in the movie. The Utrom Shredder was eventually destroyed by the Technodrome's weapons. Karai most likely retook control of the Foot at this point.</p>
